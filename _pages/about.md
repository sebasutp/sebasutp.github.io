Hi! Mi name is Sebastian. I am interested in Machine Learning and computers
in general, from small micro-controllers and single board computers to larger
scale systems.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Google, in the Search Quality team
in Zurich-Switzerland.

Before that I worked at Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, where I
was mainly working in a [robot table tennis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLK4IwpgEB4)
system. I used Probabilistic Machine learning techniques to quantify
uncertainty and use it in a challenging real time robot environment.
Something I find really cool about using machine learning instead of hard
coding the physics of Table Tennis is that we could also easily learned
other tasks, and I tested that making the robot
[prepare coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHnA2RYIWxg) was well.

On a personal note, I love cycling, drinking good coffee and cooking.
Since cycling is the hobby where I spend most time, and it is relatively easy
to collect data with a bike computer, I also have some personal tech projects
related to cycling. Feel free to visit my
[Raspberry-PI hosted website](sebasutp.ddnsgeek.com) for more information.
