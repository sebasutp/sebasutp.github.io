I currently work at Google in Search/Ranking. Before that I worked at Max-Planck doing [machine learning in Robotics](../portfolio-1/). I also worked on an ML project with [Converge](https://www.converge.io/), and spend some time teaching algorithms in my university before starting my PhD.

# Work at Google

I work in Search Quality. My work at Google is very interesting, including a lot of machine learning work, data analysis and working with a lot more data that could fit in a single machine. You can learn more how the ranking algorithm works [in this official Google post](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/ranking-results/).
